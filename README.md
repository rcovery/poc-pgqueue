## About this project

<div>I made this proof of concept to implement and test the PostgreSQL notification resource.</div>
<div>I wanted to see how it works and draw my own conclusions about it.</div>

## How to run

```bash
npm install && docker compose up
```

<div>After initialize the application, you can access the URL http://localhost:3000.</div>
There are only 3 resources:
<ul>
<li>/send/email?email=test@test.com&content=Hello%20World</li>
<li>/send/whatsapp?number=91832981312&content=Hello%20World</li>
<li>/send/paralelepipedo?content=Hello%20World</li>
</ul>

## Should I use PSQL as a message broker?

<b>Short answer</b>: no.
<br />
<b>Long answer</b>: Too much work for zero confidence, this notification resource is only for data you could loss, there is no persistence... The example showed in some articlesÂ is not good for production environments.
